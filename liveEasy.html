    <h1>"Simple Life is a Beautiful Life"</h1>
    <p>Life was a bit simpler… and the further back you go in history, the simpler life was.  Progress has brought us an overwhelming number of choices.</p>

                Think about your grandmother or great-grandmother born at the turn of the century. When she was thirsty, she drank a cup of water or perhaps milk. She didn’t have to peruse a hundred different products in the cooler at the gas station.

         With fifty different types of toothpaste and five-hundred television stations, we are faced with an insurmountable number of decisions every day. Closets full of clothes and homes stuffed with various devices to entertain us and make our lives easier, our more-is-better culture is bombarding us with trivial choices.

                    The paradox is that the more you have, the more you want. You fill your home and your schedule with things and activities, but you still feel empty. Your wheels are spinning. You feel stressed and overbooked. Breaking this cycle will free you to enjoy the things that you truly cherish, and discard the things that simply add more burden to your already heavy load.

        <p>There is no magic formula for simplifying your life. Clearing away the clutter should be less like a program and more like a new state of being. Instead of focusing on quantity (of objects, events, or relationships), you must learn to base your choices on quality.
