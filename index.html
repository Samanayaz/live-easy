          Life was a bit simpler… and the further back you go in history, the
          simpler life was. Progress has brought us an overwhelming number of
          choices.

          Think about your grandmother or great-grandmother born at the turn of
          the century. When she was thirsty, she drank a cup of water or perhaps
          milk. She didn’t have to peruse a hundred different products in the
          cooler at the gas station.

          With fifty different types of toothpaste and five-hundred television
          stations, we are faced with an insurmountable number of decisions
          every day. Closets full of clothes and homes stuffed with various
          devices to entertain us and make our lives easier, our more-is-better
          culture is bombarding us with trivial choices.

          The paradox is that the more you have, the more you want. You fill
          your home and your schedule with things and activities, but you still
          feel empty. Your wheels are spinning. You feel stressed and
          overbooked. Breaking this cycle will free you to enjoy the things that
          you truly cherish, and discard the things that simply add more burden
          to your already heavy load.

          There is no magic formula for simplifying your life. Clearing away the
          clutter should be less like a program and more like a new state of
          being. Instead of focusing on quantity (of objects, events, or
          relationships), you must learn to base your choices on quality.
